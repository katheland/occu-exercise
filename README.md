OCCU Senior Developer Exercise

Katherine Anderson

Main version:
Open index.html in a web browser.
(You can also open searchPage.html or statusPage.html directly.)
There are links to both pages in the index.
Each page also has a link to the other one at the top.

Alternate version:
I've provided an alternate version of the 37 status values that uses node.js.
Make sure node.js is installed, then navigate your terminal to the nodeVersion 
folder and run "node statusPage.js"
Then open localhost:8080 in your web browser.
(I would have liked to have done all of it using node.js, but I kept running 
into MIME type mismatch errors while trying to get the search page started, and
searching Stack Overflow wasn't giving me any useful answers.  It's probably a 
configuration thing...)

Everything was developed in Firefox, but it was tested in Chrome too.
